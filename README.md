This is a python project to automate the process of creating a repository on GitHub.

The scripts have been made to so as to reduce the process of creating a github repository into a line of command on the terminal


The terminal command to automate the process is the following : 
    project name_of_your_repo access_specify

In the above command name_of_your_repo must be replaced with what name the programmer wants to give to it's repository.
name_of_your_repo must be specified.

The access_specify must be replaced by public or private based on what the programmer wished to keep.
access_specify if not entered is considered private as default.

The access_specify property has a default of creating private repository.
To create a public repository the access_specify must be mentioned to public in the command.

The shell script must be saved to the path of the configuration shell file.
